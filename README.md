# SQFT Calculator üè°

Have a floor plan but missing the total interior SQFT? Look no further.

## Overview

While searching for my first home, I was constantly coming across houses that included their floor plan, but not the total interior SQFT. I didn't want to upload anything online and I figured it would be incredibly easy to this pull off in a Python script, so here it is.

## Using the Script

* Input the total amount of rooms and then the script will ask you for the length and width of each room, one by one.

  * Note that each input is asking for **INCHES**, not feet. You can do this conversion pretty easily on your own. ü§™

* Each input will repeat itself if you enter anything other than an integer.

* The total interior SQFT will be calculated at the end and printed to screen.
